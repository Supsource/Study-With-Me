# StudyWithMe

30 Days of 30 JavaScript Project [Repository Link.](https://github.com/Supsource/30-Days-30-JavaScript-Project-Challenge)

Day 1 of challenge to build 30 JS projects over 30 days (Study with us with timer, video and music)
A vanilla JS project with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), as well as svg files for the play and pause buttons and the timer effect. Videos (free from pixabay) uses in the background.
Times can be updated to changed to adjust the meditation timeframes offered, with alternative videos and music possible to change also.


**Disclaimer**

No copyright infringement intended with this app. I planned to create a meditation app for day 3, and there was no music more soothing that I could think of than Einaudi, and therefore this pays homage. Please go buy his music from iTunes, stream it on Spotify or go see him in concert.
